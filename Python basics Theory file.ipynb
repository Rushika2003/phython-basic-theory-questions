    "Q.1 What is python and why it is popular ?\n",
    "ANS: Python is a set of rules and symbols that define the process of writing computer program. \n",
    "     It is very popular due to its versatility, simplicity and good ecosystem of its liabrary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.2 what is an interpreter in python ?\n",
    "ANS: In python, an interpreter is a program that reads and executes a python code unlike compiled languages that translate code in machine language           ahead of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.3 What are pre defined keywords in python ?\n",
    "ANS: Following are the keywords in python - \n",
    "      false, true, and, as, assert, pass, while, break, class, continue, def, del, elif, with, else, except, finally, for, form, lobal, return, yeild,         import, in ,is, lamda, nonlocal, not, or, try.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.4 Can keywords be used as variable names ?\n",
    "ANS: No, you cannot use keywords as variable name. If we use keywords as variable name it will show syntex error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.5 What is mutability in python ?\n",
    "ANS: Mutability refers to whether the object can be changed after its created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.6 Why are lists mutable and tuples immutable ?\n",
    "ANS: Lists are designed to be flexible and dynamic. They are implemented as dynamic arrays allowing for efficient resizing and modifications. While         tuples are implemented as fixed size arrays. Their immutability offers sevral advantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.7 What is the difference between \"==\" and \"is\" operators in python ?\n",
    "ANS: In Python, the == and is operators are both used for comparison, but they serve different purposes:\n",
    "     == (Equality Operator)\n",
    "     Purpose: Compares the values of two objects to check if they are equal.\n",
    "     Behavior: Evaluates to True if the values of the objects are the same, regardless of whether they are stored at the same memory location.\n",
    "\n",
    "     is (Identity Operator)\n",
    "     Purpose: Checks if two variables refer to the same object in memory.\n",
    "     Behavior: Evaluates to True if both variables point to the exact same object in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.8 What are logical operators in Python ?\n",
    "ANS: In Python, logical operators are used to combine conditional statements and evaluate expressions that result in Boolean values (True or False).        These operators are essential for controlling the flow of a program based on multiple conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.9 What is type casting in Python ?\n",
    "ANS: In Python, type casting refers to the process of converting a variable from one data type to another. This is          essential when performing       operations that require operands of the same type or when you need to ensure compatibility between different data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.10 What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting ?\n",
    "ANS: In Python, type casting refers to converting a variable from one data type to another. This can be done in two ways: implicit and explicit type        casting.\n",
    "\n",
    "     Implicit Type Casting \n",
    "     Definition: Python automatically converts one data type to another without explicit instruction from the programmer.\n",
    "     When It Happens: Occurs when an operation involves different data types, and Python promotes the lower data type to the higher one to prevent          data loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "     Explicit Type Casting\n",
    "     Definition: The programmer manually converts a value from one data type to another using built-in functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.11 What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python ?\n",
    "ANS: In Python, conditional statements—such as if, elif, and else—are fundamental for controlling the flow of a program based on specific conditions.       They enable your program to make decisions and execute different blocks of code depending on whether certain conditions evaluate to True or False.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.12 How does the elif statement work ?\n",
    "ANS: In Python, the elif statement—short for \"else if\"—is used to evaluate multiple conditions sequentially after an initial if statement. It allows        for more than two possible outcomes, making your code more readable and efficient by avoiding nested if statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.13 What is the difference between for and while loops ?\n",
    "ANS: In Python, both for and while loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly, but they differ in their structure and use cases. Here's a         detailed comparison:\n",
    "\n",
    "    for Loop\n",
    "    Purpose: Ideal for iterating over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string) or a range of numbers.\n",
    "    Structure: Combines initialization, condition checking, and iteration in a single line.\n",
    "\n",
    "     while Loop\n",
    "     Purpose: Repeats a block of code as long as a specified condition is True.\n",
    "     Structure: Requires explicit initialization and manual updating of the loop variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.14 Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop ?\n",
    "ANS: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n"
